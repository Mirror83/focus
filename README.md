# Focus

A desktop and Android Pomodoro app to improve focus and efficiency on tasks.
This is a personal project and although there are many of such applications, I wanted to
create one to create one that is highly suited for me. And, also along the way,
reinforce my knowledge of Jetpack Compose and learn how to apply it in the unfamiliar
context of a desktop application.

Although it was supposed to be desktop-only, I decided to use this project to also act as a refresher for Android development since it's been a while.
(And also the notifications provided by ```trayState.sendNotification()``` on desktop looked pretty bad, which demotivated me since notifications are a key feature, and I did not want to implement my own notification system)
