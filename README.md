# Focus
A desktop Pomodoro app to improve focus and efficiency on tasks.
This is a personal project and although there are many of such applications, I wanted to
create one to create one that is highly suited for me. And, also along the way,
reinforce my knowledge of Jetpack Compose and learn how to apply it in the unfamiliar context of a desktop application.

## Roadmap
**To be updated**

## Project Status
The project is **in the early stages of planning and design**.

Currently, the project is basically a playground for messing
around with coroutines and Compose for Desktop.
